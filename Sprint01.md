# Sprint 01

## Day01

### Tasks Completed
Began work on authentication however the solution file was not "Blazor WebAssembly" and so we spent a lot of time converting the project

### Tasks To Do
Finish authentication

### Issues
No issues now the solution has been transfered to a WebAssembly project

## Day02

### Tasks Completed
Authentication is now complete and working with the database. Began working on different layouts for the results page as it changes depending on if the user has signed in or not.

### Tasks To Do
Finish layout results page. Begin working on algorithm for the first set of questions

### Issues 
Data cannot be easily transfered from a "page" to a "layout" so displaying any user information is difficult

## Day03

### Tasks Completed
Fixed the layout situation by adding logic to the page instead so that the users data can still be displayed. Began work on the algorithm so that when a user selects the back button their previous answers are already selected 

### Tasks To Do
Update some pages depending on whether the user is signed in or not.

### Issues 
The database does not update already completed fields and so if a user changes their mind on a question, the change is not reflected in the database.

## Day04

### Tasks Completed
When a user signs into the system when they have not completed the quiz, a skeleton outline appears in the results section, asking if they would like to complete the quiz. After the meeting, added in assets which we recieved to the website. Added in a new question type, a slider from 1-10 rather than 10 radio buttons.

### Tasks To Do
Revise current question selection as they are fairly narrow in terms of choice. 

### Issues 
Currently the database can not overwrite fields and so updating users or answer paths is not available.

## Day05 
### Tasks To Do 
Begin STAR report.
