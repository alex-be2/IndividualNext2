## Week08

## Tasks Completed
Started on creating the questions for the main part of the quiz. Refactored the database so the the node id is now stored in the question table. This stops the database from adding 3 entries every time the user answers a question. 
Fixed the issue where the user couldnt continue the quiz after not completing all questions on the page.
## Tasks To Do
Refine some of the questions so the quiz is not so long and also so that the user isnt confined when answering questions. Add in the questions to the database so they can be accessed on the website.
## Issues
The issue where the buttons do not show after being clicked on still happens.
