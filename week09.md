## Week09

## Tasks Completed
Started on the alrgorithm for the second part of the quiz however the database needed to be updated to actually implement the code.
Added in images to each department on each page so the user can determine which path they have been selected for.
Completed more of the questions to be added into the database making sure to keep them as open as possible so the user isnt taking down an undesired path

## Tasks To Do
Finish adding in the questions to the database to finish the second section of the quiz.
Start on adding results to the database so they are saved when the user completes the quiz.
## Issues
Once the user completed the first section they wouldnt be correctly directed and so we needed to change the destination making sure to include the id and session id.
