## Week 06

## Tasks Completed
Fixed issue where once a user has selected an answer, goes back and changes the answer, the value is updated on the database.

## Tasks To Do
Begin work on the main section of the quiz. Create a new component for it and add tables to the database to store which department the user got to the show the relevant questions.

## Issues
if a user has not completed all the questions but then complete them, because the state of the page has not updated they technically havent completed the questions.
